<h3>Aftersun</h3>
<p>
    Dedicated to those who now and forever live in our memories. Memories that you continue to pour over to feel their warmth, materialize their presence, to understand their world, 
    to reconcile your unsresolved emotions. Fleeting, dream like sequences you replay again and again with a hope you'll find something new this time, feel something real this time 
    until it just hurts too much and you have to look away. There's so much you'll never know, but you know there was so much love there.

<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>
    I ain't worthy bruh
</p>

<h3>Before Sunset</h3>
<p>
    Picking up nine years after 'Before Sunrise', this movie really delves into the realities of being an adult and the relationships that come with it. Brilliant thematic elements, 
    probably the best "love story" movie I've seen. Excited to watch the 3rd film of this trilogy.

<h3>The Zone of Interest</h3>
<p>
    What the fuck. Hauntingly visceral. A horror movie masquerading as a war drama. I was frozen in a state of dread by the end that lasted long after the credits rolled. This one
    is going to linger for a while.
